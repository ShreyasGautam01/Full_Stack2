Experiment 2.1: Bootstrap Card Layout
This project demonstrates a responsive grid layout using Bootstrap 5 cards within a React application. It focuses on using the Bootstrap grid system to display informative content blocks that adapt to different screen sizes.

Features
Responsive Grid: Uses the row and col-md-6 classes to display two columns on medium-to-large screens and stack them vertically on smaller devices.

Bootstrap Cards: Implements the card component featuring card-img-top for images and card-body for structured text and call-to-action buttons.

Visual Depth: Utilizes the shadow utility class to add elevation and depth to the card containers.

Fluid Layout: Employs container-fluid for a full-width experience and gx-4/gy-5 for consistent horizontal and vertical gutter spacing.

Tech Stack
Framework: React

Styling: Bootstrap 5 (CSS)

Build Tool: Vite

Implementation Details
Key Components Used:
container-fluid: Provides a full-width container for the entire layout.

card-img-top: Ensures images fit perfectly at the top of the card component.

w-100 h-100: Bootstrap utilities that force the cards to fill the entire width and height of their grid column for a uniform look.
